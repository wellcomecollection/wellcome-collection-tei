# Wellcome Collection 
## Manuscript Descriptions encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)

This repository contains TEI-encoded XML files for manuscripts held in [the library at Wellcome Collection](http://wellcomelibrary.org).

[Wellcome Collection](http://wellcomecollection.org) holds a great variety of manuscripts from regions spanning the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, South Asia, Central Asia, South East Asia, and East Asia. This repository is part of our effort to use [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) to provide consistent cataloguing descriptions that are responsive to the range of languages, layouts and scribal practices on display in these manuscript materials. 

Draft [documentation](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcome-collection-tei/tree/master/docs) for our practices is available, also in [HTML](https://ghp.wellcomecollection.org/wellcome-collection-tei/Wellcome_TEI_Manuscript_Guidelines.html) format. We follow the guidelines for TEI manuscript description defined by the [Bodleian schema](https://github.com/msDesc/consolidated-tei-schema). In time, we wish to draw on our developing experience of TEI for Asian, Middle Eastern, and North African manuscripts to suggest expansions of the Bodleian schema.
