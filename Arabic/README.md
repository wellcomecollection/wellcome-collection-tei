# Wellcome Collection's Manuscripts in Arabic

Wellcome Collection are contributors to the [FIHRIST](https://www.fihrist.org.uk/) union catalogue from the Islamicate world. This folder contains local copies of the FIHRIST descriptions. More manuscript descriptions will be added to FIHRIST in due course. 

In the meantime, further information about Wellcome Collection's manuscripts in Arabic can be found in:

* Iskandar, A.Z. (1967) [*A catalogue of Arabic manuscripts on medicine and science in the Wellcome Historical Medical Library*](https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b20086210) (searchable PDF available online)
* Serikoff, N. (2005) [*Arabic medical manuscripts of the Wellcome Library: a descriptive catalogue of the Haddad Collection*](https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b20086210) (available in hard copy print only)

Many of the manuscripts in Arabic have been digitised and are available online at:

* Via Wellcome's [library catalogue](https://wellcomelibrary.org/search-the-catalogues/)
* [Wellcome Arabic Manuscripts Online](http://wamcp.bibalex.org/)

Note that some of the manuscripts have been renumbered several times, appearing under different manuscript identifiers in print and online. 

Exemplars of calligraphy written in Arabic are included in:

* Serikoff, N. (ed.) (2007) [*Islamic calligraphy from the Wellcome Library*](http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1661158?lang=eng) (available in hard copy print only)

This work builds on the [Wellcome Arabic Manuscript Cataloguing Project (WAMCP)](http://wamcp.bibalex.org/about-us), a collaboration between Wellcome Library, Bibliotheca Alexandrina, and King's College London, funded by JISC and the Wellcome Trust between 2009 and 2011.
