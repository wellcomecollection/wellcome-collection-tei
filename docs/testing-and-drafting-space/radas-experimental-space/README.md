# Rada's experimental space



**Wellcome Collection is a free museum and library**

* We believe everyone’s experience of health matters.&#x20;
* Through our collections, exhibitions and events, in books and online, we explore the past, present and future of health.

You can find us near Euston station in London. Our exhibitions and events are always free. You can use our library and view items from our collections free of charge too – you may just need to book in advance.

Wellcome Collection opened in 2007. We care for many thousands of items relating to health, medicine and human experience, including rare books, artworks, films and videos, personal archives and objects. We’re part of [Wellcome](https://wellcome.org/), a charitable foundation supporting science to help build a healthier future for everyone.
