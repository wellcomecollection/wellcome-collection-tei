## About Us

* Wellcome Collection is a free museum and library.
* We believe everyone’s experience of health matters.
* Through our collections, exhibitions and events, in books and online, we explore the past, present and future of health.

Wellcome Collection opened in 2007. We care for many thousands of items relating to health, medicine and human experience, including rare books, artworks, films and videos, personal archives and objects. We’re part of [Wellcome](https://wellcome.org/), a charitable foundation supporting science to help build a healthier future for everyone.
