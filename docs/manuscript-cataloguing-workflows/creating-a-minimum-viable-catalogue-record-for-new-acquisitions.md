# Creating a minimum viable catalogue record for new acquisitions

On a quarterly to semi-annual basis, manuscripts recently acquired by Wellcome Collection will be catalogued in TEI to a basic standard following the guidance below. This guidance may also be used for creating minimum viable records for uncatalogued material identified during the manuscript inventory.

***

## Before you begin

* Check it has been correctly identified as a manuscript during the acquisition process. There is no strict definition of what a manuscript is at Wellcome but suitable material includes any solely handwritten texts, and **unpublished** type printed texts that lack archival structure. As part of the fast track cataloguing process, material should be assessed to check whether the manuscript collection is most suitable, particularly for printed texts which may be better described in the ephemera collection or an early printed book which may have been misidentified at point of acquisition. &#x20;
* Check a manuscript number has already been allocated in the Sierra order record or CALM accession record. If it doesn't have a number, contact Collections Development for the next rolling number. &#x20;
* Check whether a permanent location has been given for the item in either the Sierra order record or CALM accession record. If no permanent item location has been given, contact Conservation and Collections Care to determine a location for the material. If there are any repackaging or other conservation concerns outstanding, these should also be communicated at this point.&#x20;

Ideally a permanent location should be given before cataloguing begins but it can be carried out if still awaiting. In these cases, Conservation and Collections Care will be responsible for updating the location, status and opacmsg in Sierra once a location has been found. &#x20;

## Creating and modifying SIERRA bibliographic record

If there is already an order record in Sierra, use the b number for the attached bib record to fill in the information below. Otherwise, create a dummy bibliographic record in Sierra.&#x20;

Leave default values, only adding or editing the following:&#x20;

## Creating TEI record&#x20;

* Log on to Github and navigate to the [minimum viable record template](../../Templates/Wellcome_TEI_MS_Minimum_Viable_Record_Template.xml). Click on ‘copy raw contents’ and paste into a blank text file in your preferred xml editor. At Wellcome Collection we currently have access to Oxygen and Visual Studio Code.
* Save this file on your local machine (laptop) as the MS reference number with underscores replacing any dots or dashes e.g. MS\_9599
* Fill in the data in this XML file according to the green coloured comments. The following table covers all the core tags that need to be completed between the tags (><) and quotation marks (“”) in the XML file.

N.B. Lines in code referred to in the table below are to make it easier to identify where data needs to be edited for a minimum viable record. Where the code will be in the file may change as you begin to enter data, so don't worry if they aren't exactly where it says they should be!&#x20;
