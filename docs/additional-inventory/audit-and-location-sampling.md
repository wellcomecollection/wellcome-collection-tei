# Audit and location sampling

We run quarterly location sampling of inventoried manuscripts, in line with quarterly audit requirements. To reflect the range and locations of the manuscript inventory so far, which is divided across catalogued (in TEI) and uncatalogued material across basement planchest and shelf locations, we sample the following:

* 3 manuscripts housed in planchest drawers, randomly chosen from the drawers and checked against the Quickbase data.
* 3 manuscripts housed in planchest drawers, randomly chosen from the Quickbase data and checked for location in the planchest drawers.
* 3 manuscripts on the shelves, randomly selected from the shelves and checked against the Quickbase data.
* 3 manuscripts on the shelves, randomly selected from the Quickbase data and checked for location on the shelves.

The total 12 was initially chosen to represent the roughly 1000 TEI-catalogued, inventoried manuscripts and the growing number of uncatalogued manuscripts, and is expected to be adjusted upwards as manuscript inventory evolves.
