# Audit and location sampling

We run quarterly location sampling of inventoried manuscripts, in line with quarterly audit requirements. To reflect the range and locations of manuscript inventory so far, which is divided across catalogued (in TEI) and uncatalogued material across basement planchest and shelf locations, we are sampling the following:

* 5 manuscripts housed in planchest drawers, randomly chosen from the drawers and checked against the Quickbase data.
* 5 manuscripts housed in planchest drawers, randomly chosen from the Quickbase data and checked for location in the planchest drawers.
* 5 manuscripts on the shelves, randomly selected from the shelves and checked against the Quickbase data.
* 5 manuscripts on the shelves, randomly selected from the Quickbase data and checked for location on the shelves.

The total 20 (adjusted from 12, starting Q3, 24/25) is chosen to represent the roughly 1000 TEI-catalogued, inventoried manuscripts and the growing number of inventoried uncatalogued manuscripts.

### Recording location audit sampling

The first-level sampling is recorded in spreadsheets organised in the following style:

| INV Number/Shelfmark | Location on Quicbase | Title/brief descriptuion | Was item found in lcoation (Y.N) | Date | Recorder | Is location same/accurate on Sierra if applicable? | Notes/Comments |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
|                      |                      |                          |                                  |      |          |                                                    |                |

These are stored in Inventory/Manuscripts/Location Sampling in the Collections Information Sharepoint folder.

The high-level results are entered in the aggregate locations audit report spreadsheet. For the purposes of manuscript location sampling, we work with the following definitions:

> Missing - manuscripts not physically present in their locations

> Data issues - any metadata issues (such as inaccurate location or description in Sierra/QB/TEI)
